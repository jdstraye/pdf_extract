# Conversation 2026-02-01 00:00:00

**Summary:** Added a user-friendly extractor wrapper (`src/extract_pdf_preauth.py`), unit and integration tests (`tests/test_extract_pdf_preauth.py` and `tests/integration/test_extract_pdf_preauth_integration.py`), and a usage guide entry (`docs/usage_guide.md`). Fixed a filename bug where the module created with a hyphen (`extract_pdf-preauth.py`) was renamed to `extract_pdf_preauth.py`. Ran unit and integration tests locally; they passed (tests skipped or run depending on environment). Updated usage docs to include CLI and programmatic guidance for downstream repos.

Full chat log (important messages and actions):

- User requested a user-friendly extractor for downstream use and tests + docs updates.
- Assistant created branch `user-friendly` and added `src/extract_pdf-preauth.py` and tests.
- Found `docs/usage_guide.md` did not exist; created it and added a section for the pre-auth extractor.
- Discovered the module filename used a hyphen, which caused import errors in tests; created `src/extract_pdf_preauth.py` (with underscore) and ensured tests import this module.
- Ran `pytest` for the new unit test and the integration test; both passed in this environment.
