# Conversation 20260201-211045

**Summary:**
- Canonicalized late-pays field to flat keys `late_pays_lt2yr` and `late_pays_gt2yr`.
- Normalized tests to prefer flat keys and added `tests/test_late_pays_canonical.py`.
- Generated triage report and applied authoritative GT fixes for 10 users; removed nested `late_pays` from GT files.
- Added `docs/usage_guide.md` and linked it in `README.md`.
- Verified diffs are zero after fixes using `scripts/generate_gt_diffs.py` with PyMuPDF active; full test run shows 3 failing tests (PDF vs GT mismatches) that require triage.
